# .vim

My local vim installation folder, including `.vimrc` files.

# Installation

This is the actual, local, `.vim` installation folder.

To install it, just clone the git repo into the machine's `.vim` folder.  

The local `.vim` folder doesn't have to necessarily be `~/.vim`. It is possible,
for instance, using symlinks, to have it linked to any folder you want.
